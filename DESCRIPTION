Title: Test Bench for Comparison of Data Prediction Models
Version: 1.1.1
Author: Neeraj Bokde
Maintainer: Neeraj Bokde <neerajdhanraj@gmail.com>
Description: Provides a Testbench for comparison of prediction models. This
    package is inspired from 'imputeTestbench' package
    <https://cran.r-project.org/package=imputeTestbench>. It compares prediction
    models with reference to RMSE, MAE or MAPE parameters. It allows to add new
    proposed methods to test bench and to compare with other methods. The function
    'prediction_append()' allows to add multiple numbers of methods to the existing
    methods available in test bench. One/two step ahead prediction is also possible
    in the testbench.
